Basic Rules:
Play always moves around the board in a counter-clockwise circle (to the right)
The store on your right belongs to you. That is where you keep the seeds you win.
The six pits near you are your pits.
Only put seeds in your own store, not your opponent’s store.
Special Rules:
When the last seed in your hand lands in your store, take another turn.
When the last seed in your hand lands in one of your own pits, if that pit had been empty you get to keep all of the seeds in your opponents pit on the opposite side. Put those captured seeds, as well as the last seed that you just played on your side, into the store.
Ending the Game:
The game is over when one player’s pits are completely empty. The other player takes the seeds remaining in her pits and puts those seeds in her store. Count up the seeds. Whoever has the most seeds wins.
